# cvs-svc-test-types

## Introduction

The test-types microservice contains some reference data to be used for CVS services and mobile application for DVSA.

## Dependencies

The project runs on node >10.x with typescript and serverless framework. For further details about project dependencies, please refer to the `package.json` file.
[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md) is used to managed node versions and configuration explicitly done per project using an `.npmrc` file.

### Prerequisites

Please install and run the following securiy programs as part of your development process:

- [git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets)
  After installing, do a one-time set up with `git secrets --register-aws`. Run with `git secrets --scan`.

- [repo-security-scanner](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/repo-security-scanner)

These will be run as part of your projects hooks so you don't accidentally introduce any new security vulnerabilities.

## Architecture

Data is used is made available to VTA for searching a vehicle.
Please refer to the the [docs](./docs/README.md) for the API specification and samples of postman requests.

### Defect microservice

More information about technical designs can be found under the [Test type Microservice](https://wiki.dvsacloud.uk/display/HVT/Test+Types+Microservice) section.

## Getting started

Set up your nodejs environment running `nvm use` and once the dependencies are installed using `npm i`, you can run the scripts from `package.json` to build your project.
This code repository uses [serverless framework](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/) to mock AWS capabilities for local development.
You will also require to install dynamodb serverless to run your project with by running the following command `npm run tools-setup` in your preferred shell.
Please refer to the local development section to [configure your project locally](#developing-locally).

### Environmental variables

- The `BRANCH` environment variable indicates in which environment is this application running. Use `BRANCH=local` for local development. This variable is required when starting the application or running tests.

### Scripts

The following scripts are available, however you can refer to the `package.json` to see the details:

- installing dependencies: `npm install`
- local development by starting the service: `npm start`
- building the project: `npm run build`
- unit tests: `npm t`
- integration tests: `npm run test-i`

### DynamoDB and seeding

You won't need to change the configuration.
However, if you want the database to be populated with mock data on start, in your `serverless.yml` file, you need to set `seed` to `true`. You can find this setting under `custom > dynamodb > start`.

If you choose to run the DynamoDB instance separately, you can send the seed command with the following command:

`sls dynamodb seed --seed=test-types`

Under `custom > dynamodb > seed` you can define new seed operations with the following config:

```yml
custom:
  dynamodb:
    seed:
      [SEED NAME HERE]:
        sources:
          - table: [TABLE TO SEED]
            sources: [./path/to/resource.json]
```

### Developing locally

Default DynamoDB configuration for seeding the data:

```yml
migrate: true
seed: true
noStart: false
```

### Debugging

The following environmental variables can be given to your serverless scripts to trace and debug your service:

```shell
AWS_XRAY_CONTEXT_MISSING = LOG_ERROR
SLS_DEBUG = *
BRANCH = local
```

## Testing

Jest is used for unit testing.
Please refer to the [Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started) for further details.

### Unit test

In order to test, you need to run the following:

```sh
npm run test # unit tests
```

### Integration test

In order to test, you need to run the following, with the service running locally:

```sh
npm run test-i # for integration tests
```

## Infrastructure

We follow a [gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) approach for development.
For the CI/CD and automation please refer to the following pages for further details:

- [Development process](https://wiki.dvsacloud.uk/display/HVT/CVS+Pipeline+Infrastructure)
- [Pipeline](https://wiki.dvsacloud.uk/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=36870584)

## Contributing

Please familiarise yourself with [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) and [conventional commits conventions](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/) as a hook is in place to enforce standards.

### Hooks and code standards

The projects has multiple hooks configured using [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky#readme) which will execute the following scripts: `security-checks`, `audit`, `tslint`, `prepush`.
The codebase uses [typescript clean code standards](https://github.com/labs42io/clean-code-typescript) as well as sonarqube for static analysis.

SonarQube is available locally, please follow the instructions below if you wish to run the service locally (brew is the preferred approach).

### Static code analysis

_Brew_ (recommended):

- Install sonarqube using brew
- Change `sonar.host.url` to point to localhost, by default, sonar runs on `http://localhost:9000`
- run the sonar server `sonar start`, then perform your analysis `npm run sonar-scanner`

_Manual_:

- [Download sonarqube](https://www.sonarqube.org/downloads/)
- Add sonar-scanner in environment variables in your profile file add the line: `export PATH=<PATH_TO_SONAR_SCANNER>/sonar-scanner-3.3.0.1492-macosx/bin:$PATH`
- Start the SonarQube server: `cd <PATH_TO_SONARQUBE_SERVER>/bin/macosx-universal-64 ./sonar.sh start`
- In the microservice folder run the command: `npm run sonar-scanner`
